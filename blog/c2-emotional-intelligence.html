    <li> What learnings did you take from the chapter?  </li>
</ul>
<p>
I learned how our brain can be trained to be more mindful, mindfulness is a state of where you aware of your feeling, thus develops the ability to control your emotions.
With intentional practice of mindfulness and meditation techniques we can alter the brain structure,
the many benefits of having high EI was very surprising, leading to happiness, higher work performance and leadership ability.

<ul>
    <li>  How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness? </li>
</ul>
<p>
I am suprised how easy it is to practice mindfulness and how it can reduce stress. This can be really helpfull when you are trying to focus on work.
After reading this I want to learn more about and practice meditation.

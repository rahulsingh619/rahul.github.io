    <li> What is grid based design?  </li>
</ul>
<p>
A grid is a structure made up of a series of intersecting straight (vertical,horizontal, and angular) or curved guide lines used to structure content.
The grid serves as an armature or framework on which a designer can organize graphic elements.

</ul>
<p>
With the multitude of devices out there - desktops, laptops, phones, responsive design means developing websites which will resize and adapt to different sizes of screen (different resolutions) and types of devices, ensuring the website is still legible and is looking great.

<p> Htlm and Css seem fairly straight forawrd, but there are alot of key elements you need to know. It can be confusing and challenging at start but once you get into it and are going in the right direction, writing html doesn't seem to hard and can be very addictive.
  This week I feel much more confident reading and writing html, due to the time spent reading, watching and practicing html and css.

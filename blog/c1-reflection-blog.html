  <ul>
    <li> Whats your take on the DBC/EDA experience? </li>
</ul>
<p> So far the EDA experience and learning programme has been positive due to lots of help from peers and easy access to resources.</p>

<ul>
  <li> What are your impressions? </li>
</ul>
    <p> The campus seems like a pretty chilled place and is a good working enviroment where it is not hard to ask for or get help. I am excited about learning new skills that will help me at work and the campus provides good resources and a great place to study.  </p>

<ul>
  <li> How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? </li>
</ul>
    <p> I've been told there will be alot of group learning which I am excited for, because it is always good to share ideas and to help each other to get ahead. </p>

<ul>
  <li> Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how? </li>
</ul>
    <p> My expectations have not changed, I just have to work hard and make a effort so I can learn these new skills to the best of my ability.  </p>

<ul>
  <li> Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make ou nervous? </li>
</ul>
     <p> I am very excited to take part in this type of learning, I am looking forward to meeting other's in my Cohort and learning new skills and idea's from them. I only get a little nervous at the start of a topic but once I get into it it doesn't seem to bad </p>

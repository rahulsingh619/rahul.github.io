    <h4>My Reflection </h4>

    <p> So far the EDA experience and learning programme has been positive due to lots of help from peers.</p>
    <p> The campus seems like a pretty chilled place and is a good working enviroment where it is not hard to ask for or get help. I am excited about learning new skills that will help me at work and the campus provides good resources and a great place to study.  </p>
    <p> I've been told there will be alot of group learning which I am excited for, because it is always good to share ideas and to help each other to get ahead. </p>
    <p> My expectations have not changed, I just have to work hard and make a effort so I can learn these new skills to the best of my ability.  </p>
    <p> I am very excited to take part in this type of learning, I only get a little nervous at the start of a topic but once I get into it it doesn't seem to bad </p>

    <li>  Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend? </li>
</ul>
<p>
A house has rooms, and each room contains furniture and electric appliances. Similarly, a webpage has sections (e.g. header, body, footer), and each section contains images and text. HTML organizes and presents elements of a webpage in a structured hierarchy.
Not all rooms, tables, and chairs look the same, nor do words or images on a page. That’s where CSS comes in – CSS defines how elements look, describing their color, size, position, shape, and more.
It is helpful to think of the DOM as the plan or layout of the house. The DOM will tell you how many rooms you have, whether that room is a bedroom or a bathroom, what these rooms contain and how they are styled.
 You have the ability to rearrange, add and delete things within the DOM before committing to a final blueprint, much like you would when renovating a house.

<ul>
<li>  What is meant by boxifying design? </li>
</ul>
<p> Every element on a web page is contained in a rectangle, in other words a box. Boxifying design means taking every element of a webpage design and dividing it into boxes </p>

<ul>
<li> What is the box model? </li>
</ul>
<p> The box model consists of margins, borders, padding and content, which together make up every HTML element on the page. Each of these aspects can be adjusted to create different styles, effects and spacing.

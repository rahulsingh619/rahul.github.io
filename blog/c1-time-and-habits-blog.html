          <p> I have tried the Pomodoro technique </p>
          <p> What I found interesting about the Pomodoro technique was I felt more motivated after each break.  </p>
          <p> Using the Pomodoro technique I managed to keep myself fresh which has helped me study for a overall longer peroid of time throughout the day. </p>
          <p> I want to continue using the Pomodoro technique because it seems to work well, I also want to get more into meditation for when I am taking a break. </p>
